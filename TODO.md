# Todo
- [x] Env shorthand
- [x] String interpolation
- [x] Aliases
- [x] Env vars
- [x] Sub commands
- [x] Floats
- [x] Tests
- [x] Decl requires $ but shouldn't
- [x] alias highlighting at call site
- [x] refactor into subcrates
- [x] subcommand alias
- [x] type inference from successful parse (eg not `List<unknown>` but `List<int>`)
- [x] parsing tables
- [x] Block params
- [x] Ranges
- [x] Column path
- [x] ...rest without calling it rest
- [x] Iteration (`each`) over tables
- [x] Row conditions
- [x] Simple completions
- [x] Detecting `$it` currently only looks at top scope but should find any free `$it` in the expression (including subexprs)
- [x] Signature needs to make parameters visible in scope before block is parsed
- [x] Externals
- [ ] Support for `$in`
- [ ] Value serialization
- [ ] Handling rows with missing columns during a cell path
- [ ] Error shortcircuit (stopping on first error)
- [ ] ctrl-c support
- [ ] operator overflow
- [ ] finish operator type-checking
- [ ] Source
- [ ] Overlays (replacement for `autoenv`)
- [ ] let [first, rest] = [1, 2, 3] (design question: how do you pattern match a table?)
  
## Maybe: 
- [ ] default param values?
- [ ] Unary not?
